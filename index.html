<h1>Your Favorite Movies are Racist</h1>

    <em>Lord Of the Rings</em> is an amazing series with many famous characters, and yet not a single one of those characters is black. <em>Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, The walking dead, Iron man,</em> and the iconic <em>Indiana Jones</em> are shows that you’ve probably heard of and maybe enjoy. Despite these shows all having many differences, there is one detail that binds them together. They’re all racist.
  </p>
  <h3>What Makes a Show Racist?</h3>
  <p>
    According to Study.com, racism is defined as “the unequal treatment of others based solely on race or ethnicity”. Racism can be subtle and often is, especially in the media you can find on television. In fact, the film industry has a very racist history and even now its effects still linger, with only 10.4% of films featuring a Black protagonist. Featuring black characters in a show isn’t difficult, and it honestly seems like industries spend more energy fighting against people of color then they would if they simply embraced them. 
  </p>
  <h3>The DuVarney and Bechdel test</h3>
  <p>
    It can be difficult to tell what’s actually racist and what’s not, luckily there is a way to detect these subtle signs of prejudice through a simple assessment known as the DuVarney test.
  </p>
  <p>
    The DuVarney test was inspired by the Bechdel test, a test made to determine if a film features a very minimal amount of acceptable female representation. The test was named after Ava DuVernay and created by Manohla Dargis, and is meant to evaluate if a piece of media had an acceptable amount of representation for people of color or ethnicity (mainly women), and surprisingly, many of our favorite films fail both assesments!
  </p>
  <h3>The Hardest Exam?</h3>
  <p>
    The criteria to pass are very simple, and both test consist of only a few basic rules, though this section will focus on the DuVarney test specifically. 
  </p>
  <h4>The DuVarney Assesment</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>There must be at least <strong>two named characters of color</strong> (preferably female)</li>
    <li>The characters should have more to them than just being a support for a white character, and <strong>must have their own life outside of a white character’s affairs.</strong></li>
    <li>The two characters <strong>must talk about something other than race or a white character.</strong>(The interaction doesn't count if it's based on them having a romantic relationship)</li>
    <li>The characters <strong>should not be stereotyped or portrayed as helpless</strong> victims in need of a white protagonist's saving, <strong>victimising is just as racist as criminalising.</strong></li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    These rules are very simple, and yet there are thousands of films that fail to meet all the criteria! But how do our favorite series score?
