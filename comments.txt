Owen Moore: Does this only affect older movies since I see a lot of the movies on your chart are older movies.
Izahbel Williams: There's actually a lot of more recent movies that fail to include proper ethnic characters, when I was talking about Indiana Jones I was talking about the whole series including its newest movie that came out in 2023, the newest walking dead season came out in 2022, and in my original draft I was going to talk about the Iron Man trilogy as well. Also, the point of the blog wasn't really about how recent the movie was but how popular, the fact that movies like that can remain popular/influential for so long without receiving much critique shows how normalized lack of representation in media is.
Jaxon Barrett: I like how you made good claims and not just random takes but why actually made sense and I never noticed that all these movies did these things so thank you for bringing light to them.
Zane Jasmin: I like how you gave examples in the movies and showed what the flaws were. 
Goober123: It's a really good way of pointing out how popular media misses out in some ways, it's pretty enlightening to see it said.
Rivera456: I've heard of the Bechdel test before but never the DuVernay test, pretty swag! Also India Jones and Lord of Rings having whole series and still failing the test is crazy
Bram Moreinis:Really strong content here!  And you come right out and say it on top.  I love your writing style / voice and the clarity of your thinking.  You use bold markup to emphasize your points very well in the section on the DuVarney assessment.  I can really feel the outrage at how rarely movies pass this simple test.
